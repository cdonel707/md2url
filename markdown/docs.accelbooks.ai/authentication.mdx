# Authentication & API Details - AccelBooks-Docs

AccelBooks ensures that all API interactions are secure and authenticated using Auth0, with fine-grained permissions and UUIDs for enhanced security. This guide details how to authenticate API requests and outlines our security measures.

## Overview

Authentication is mandatory for all API requests to guarantee that only authorized users can access sensitive financial data. We utilize Auth0, a leading identity provider, to manage user authentication securely.

### Key Features:

  * **Auth0 Integration** : Secure and scalable user authentication.
  * **Fine-Grained Permissions** : Detailed access control for data security.
  * **UUIDs** : Unique identifiers for all entities to enhance traceability and security.



## Obtaining API Credentials

To interact with the AccelBooks API, you must have valid credentials, which include a `client_id` and `client_secret`. These are provided directly by our team to ensure proper setup and integration.

### Steps to Obtain Credentials:

  1. **Contact AccelBooks** : Reach out to our support or sales team to request API access.
  2. **Provide Application Details** : Submit your application details, including your business needs and intended use of the API.
  3. **Receive Credentials** : Upon approval, we will provide you with a `client_id` and `client_secret` specific to your application.



## Authenticating Requests

Once you receive your credentials, use them to request an access token. This token must be included in the header of each API request.

### Requesting an Access Token

### Response:

Include the `access_token` in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for all subsequent API requests.

## Using UUIDs

Each entity within the AccelBooks system (e.g., transactions, companies, developers) is identified by a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). UUIDs ensure that each entity is globally unique and secure.

## Fine-Grained Permissions

Fine-grained permissions allow you to specify exactly what data each authenticated user can access. When setting up your Auth0 roles, you can define permissions that match your organizationâ€™s security policies.

### Example of Role-Based Access Control:

  * **Admin** : Full access to all API endpoints.
  * **Developer** : Access limited to developer-related endpoints.
  * **Auditor** : Read-only access to financial reports and transactions.



## Secure Best Practices

  * **Securely store credentials** : Never hard-code credentials in your applications. Use environment variables or secure vaults.
  * **Rotate secrets regularly** : Change your client secrets periodically to maintain security.
  * **Monitor and log access** : Track API usage and access patterns to detect any anomalies.
