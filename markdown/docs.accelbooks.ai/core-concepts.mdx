  * **Access Token** : Token-based authentication for individual sessions.



**Relevant API Endpoints:**

### **Error Handling**

The API returns structured error messages when something goes wrong. Typical error codes include:

  * **400 Bad Request** : The request was malformed or invalid.

  * **404 Not Found** : The requested resource doesn’t exist.
