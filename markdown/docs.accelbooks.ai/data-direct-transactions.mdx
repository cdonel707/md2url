# Your Transactions - AccelBooks-Docs

AccelBooks offers a Transaction API that allows for direct manipulation of transaction data within your application. This setup provides an alternative to third-party integrations like Plaid, offering greater control over how transactions are processed and managed.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have the required API credentials, which include `client_id` and `client_secret`, necessary for authenticating requests to the API.

## Transaction API Endpoints

Utilize the following endpoints to manage transactions for a specific company:

  * `POST /company/:id/transactions` – Add new transactions for a specified company.
  * `GET /company/:id/transactions` – Retrieve all transactions for a specified company.
  * `GET /company/:id/transactions/{transactionId}` – Retrieve details of a specific transaction for a specified company.
  * `PUT /company/:id/transactions/{transactionId}` – Update an existing transaction for a specified company.
  * `DELETE /company/:id/transactions/{transactionId}` – Remove a specific transaction for a specified company.



### Adding a Transaction

To add a transaction to a specific company, send a POST request with the transaction details:

#### Request

Replace `:id` with the actual company ID to which the transaction belongs.

#### Successful Response

#### Error Response

## Best Practices

  * **Validation** : Validate data on the client side before submitting it to ensure it meets API requirements and enhances user experience.
  * **Error Handling** : Implement robust error handling to manage API request failures gracefully.
  * **Security** : Secure all communications with the API using HTTPS to protect sensitive financial data.
